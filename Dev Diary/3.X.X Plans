Soon, we will move to 3.0, and there will be a set of 3.X updates as we get into more stable development. I expect to do 10 of these before refocusing for 4.X stuff which will involve more engine-y stuff.

Current planned updates:

- Import/Library system
- Draw objects (more clear functions that draw something specific with parameters. Technically already possible, but I'd like them to have their own type)
- Mode objects (think like classes for specific drawings/animations that have their own internal functions and parameters, essentially instead of sending each canvas/animation, a mode will handle that)
- Animation support (loop objects in code, as well as tooling in the editor)
- In/Out transitions (relies on mode and animation objects to be implemented first)
- Debugger/Runner in-house
- Text support
- IDE overhaul including linting and documentation support
- Canvas GUI overhaul including icons and better-organized shortcuts
- Comprehensive settings menus.

PS: for those wondering, here are some features I expect to bring for 4.X updates

- Download exe and guides to set up with your own matrix
- TSPMO editor support
- Support for different-sized canvasses
- Effective .qgc and .qgca decompilation
- Image support
- API Support
