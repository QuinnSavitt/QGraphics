GUI up and running! I almost exclusively work backend normally, so designing this engine for users is gonna be a unique challenge (and I have no idea how to make a GUI look good lol). 
The GUI doesn't really integrate with the rest of my work yet, but the intention is to eventually allow stepping through programs and watching the effects on the canvas. 
Soon, my parts will arrive for the matrix itself, so then I have to integrate this with that while still allowing others to do the same. I'll burn that bridge when I get to it.
